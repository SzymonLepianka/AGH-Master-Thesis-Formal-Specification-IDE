version 0.2
  - Used a  balanced binary tree for long buckets, to have
  O(log N) amortized worst case guarantee for the add, mem and
  remove operations; v_occ is not anymore a bitvector, but an array
  of the sizes of the buckets, to control when to switch from a list 
  to a tree.
  - Added unit testing
